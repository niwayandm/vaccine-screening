# Vaccine Screening

This is a website project that I did as a Data Science Freelance for predicting whether someone will get a vaccine or not based on their previous medical record. I used Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter-tuning to get an accuracy of 75%. The website was made using HTML and the model was deployed using Flask.

The dataset used in this project has been omitted for confidentiality reasons.
